# Docker Compose

Here's my collection of docker services i'm running and testing in my lab.

+ [Docker standalone](Docker%20Compose/Docker%20standalone): Simple compose.yaml files.
+ [Docker + Traefik + Lets's Encrypt](Docker%20Compose/Docker%20+%20Traefik%20+%20Lets's%20Encrypt): all services run behind the traefik reverse proxy with valid ssl certificates.

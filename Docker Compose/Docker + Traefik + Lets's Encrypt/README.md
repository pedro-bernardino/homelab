Docker + traefik + Let's encrypt

Here's my collection of bash script to deploy the services i use behind a reverse proxy (Traefik). Simply tweak to your environment and deploy!

> [!WARNING]
> All the scripts only work if you use ssh certificate-based authentication. I use a [proxmox cloud init vm template](Proxmox/cloud-init-VM-template/README.md) configured with ssh certificate. 

This is a work in progress, more services will be added in the future.
